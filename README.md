jvamisc
=======

**jvamisc** is a package of miscellaneous functions for the [R programming language](http://www.r-project.org/).

You should be able to access the functions by installing them directly from within R.

	library("devtools")
	devtools::install_github("jvadams/jvamisc")
	library(jvamisc)

If you don't already have `Rtools` and `devtools`, you will need to download and install Rtools 3.1 from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), 
	the Comprehensive R Archive Network, then run the following lines of code before submitting the code above:

	find_rtools()
	install.packages("devtools")
